# 🌌 Welcome to AnuverseHQ

AnuverseHQ is the home for innovative and community-driven open-source projects. This organization is designed to allow contributions from the open-source community while maintaining the ability to be commercially used by the project owner. Here, we aim to build high-quality tools, libraries, and frameworks that solve real-world problems, with a special focus on collaboration and growth.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### ⚡ Seraph (JavaScript Library)
Seraph is a JavaScript library designed to simplify data-driven API calls, leveraging the built-in fetch method to proxy API requests. Inspired by the functionality of Supabase and Firebase, Seraph enables easy interaction with backends while maintaining flexibility for various use cases.

### 🛡️ Throne (Backend Library)
Throne is a backend library built for handling CRUD operations using string-based manipulation to ensure prepared statements. It provides a simple, consistent interface to handle typical backend data operations and integrates smoothly with the Seraph library.

### 🌐 qRPC-Socket (Networking Project)
qRPC-Socket is a hybrid protocol that combines the simplicity of WebSockets, the procedural call structure of gRPC, and the query-handling abilities of GraphQL. Built in Rust and designed to scale, this project offers a flexible communication protocol for real-time, event-driven applications.

### 🔧 PseudoFlow (Code Generation Plugin)
PseudoFlow is an open-source plugin designed to generate production-ready code from pseudo code or commands. It simplifies the transition from human-readable logic to actual code, supporting Test-Driven Development (TDD) with full extensibility. This plugin is the open-source portion of the project, with a commercial version (temporarily named **AetherCode**) under development, offering enhanced features and integration.
