# 🌌 Welcome to AnuverseHQ

AnuverseHQ is the home for innovative and community-driven open-source projects. Our goal is to build libraries and tools that scale across platforms, covering front-end, back-end, and full-stack needs. Here, we focus on creating powerful solutions that anyone can use and contribute to, while maintaining the flexibility for future commercial applications.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### ⚡ Seraph (Omniplatform API Client)
Seraph is evolving into an omniplatform API client, supporting JavaScript, Flutter, and other environments. It simplifies data-driven API calls by abstracting common API operations (CRUD) while ensuring compatibility across platforms. Future versions will integrate backend services to work seamlessly with Throne, making it a full-stack library.

### 🛡️ Throne (Omniplatform Backend Library)
Throne is a back-end library optimized for cross-platform usage. Originally built using string-based manipulation for CRUD operations, it's now expanding to use more secure and optimized techniques like parameterized queries, prepared statements, and microservices architecture. Throne aims to provide scalability, security, and seamless integration with both client and server-side platforms.

### 🌐 qRPC-Socket (Hybrid Communication Protocol)
qRPC-Socket combines the benefits of WebSockets, gRPC, and GraphQL to provide a flexible, real-time communication protocol for event-driven and microservice architectures. Built in Rust, this protocol supports high scalability and can serve as the backbone of modern distributed applications.

### 🔧 PseudoFlow (Code-to-Pseudo Code Converter)
PseudoFlow is a plugin for VSCode and IntelliJ that converts your source code into pseudo code. It helps developers document their codebases in human-readable form, aiding both learning and documentation efforts. PseudoFlow is an open-source project, and it serves as the foundation for the more advanced commercial versions (e.g., **AetherCode** or **ArcaneFlow**) that build additional functionality on top of the base plugin.
